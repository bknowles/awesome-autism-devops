Awesome Autism resources for and from the DevOps Community

## Introduction

This is a collection of resources that I have found in my journey on the Autism spectrum, including those that have been recommended to me by others. I'm specifically going to focus on those resources that I find to be helpful to me personally, or that I believe are useful to the overall "Autism in DevOps" community.

You don't have to be a member of the DevOps community to contribute here.  Just send me a PR on GitHub, or an e-mail message, and I can take a look at it and potentially incorporate it here.  If you're going to send me an e-mail on this subject, please include "awesome-autism-devops" on the subject line, to help me with automated mail filtering, etc....

I know there are other "awesome autism" resources out there, and I will be linking to at least some of them below.  But I don't want to copy anything from them.  However, if I find anything on them that I consider useful to me or the community, then I will reference it and link to their page.

## :thinking: Concepts

- At the DevOpsDays Austin 2024 conference, I helped organize a couple of "Autism in DevOps" open spaces, and in one of those sessions, I heard from a woman who told us that she was Autistic, and her three childred were also Autistic.  She added that Autism showed up differently in each of them.  She said: "Autism is not a Spectrum.  It is a Spectrum of Spectrums".  That really hit home for me.
- At the Cloud Austin "Dog Days of DevOps 2024" meeting, after I gave my five minute talk on the subject of Autism in DevOps, and asked the audience for what resources they found to be useful, an attendee came up to me afterwards and said that he found "... the most important thing was to meet them at their level, wherever they may be."

## :tv: Videos

- [@momonthespectrum](http://www.youtube.com/@MomontheSpectrum) -- not only is Taylor Heaton herself Autistic, but she is also a therapist in this space, and talks about multiple different spectrum behaviours and potential accomodations or ways to work with them, and also has interviews with other people, such as her own therapist that helped her get to where she is today.  This YouTube channel was the first major resource I found in my journey.
- [TEDx: Failing at Normal: An ADHD Success Story](https://youtu.be/JiwZQNYlGQI?si=DzTXzVXsoCc1Bvtr) -- Although Jessica McCabe is talking about ADHD, there is a lot of overlap between ADHD and Autism, and many of the things she talks about are equally applicable to both communities.

## :green_book: Books

- [The Nonvisible Part of the Autism Spectrum : Could You be a "Little Bit Autistic?"](https://a.co/d/3CWsdzD) -- This is "Optimistic Autism Book 1" by David William Plummer.  He also has a pretty famous YouTube channel (called "Dave's Garage"), but he doesn't talk about Autism much on his channel, so I'm not linking it.
- [Secrets of the Autistic Millionaire](https://a.co/d/7CqgJec) -- This is "Optimistic Autism Book 2" by David William Plummer.

## :writing_hand: Articles

- [DevOps and Autism Care](https://www.usenix.org/publications/loginonline/devops-autism-care) -- Zac Nickens is approaching this issue from the other end than I was thinking of, but absolutely should have been.  He has two autistic children, and he and his wife (and their greater care team) are applying DevOps principles towards managing the care for these children.  Fascinating but short read.

## :link: Other Awesome Autism resources

- [Awesome Autism](https://github.com/aspergirl-git/awesome-autism/) -- when I first searched for "Awesome Autism Resources", I didn't find any of the normal "awesome" repos on github.  But then I wasn't searching on Github.  When I repeated that search on github, this was the first repo that was returned.  And I've learned how to do better GitHub Formatted Markup from her example.  So, thank you to @aspergergirl-git!
