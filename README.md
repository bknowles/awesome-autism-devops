## Awesome Autism resources for and from the DevOps Community

This is a collection of resources that I have found in my journey on the Autism spectrum, including those that have been recommended to me by others. I'm specifically going to focus on those resources that I find to be helpful to me personally, or that I believe are useful to the overall "Autism in DevOps" community.

You don't have to be a member of the DevOps community to contribute here.  Just send me a PR on GitHub, or an e-mail message, and I can take a look at it and potentially incorporate it here.  If you're going to send me an e-mail on this subject, please include "awesome-autism-devops" on the subject line, to help me with automated mail filtering, etc....

I know there are other "awesome autism" resources out there, and I will be linking to them below.  But I don't want to copy anything from them.  However, if I find anything on them that I consider useful to me or the community, then I will link to their page.
